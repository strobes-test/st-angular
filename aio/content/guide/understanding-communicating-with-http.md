# Understanding communicating with backend services using HTTP

Most front-end applications need to communicate with a server over the HTTP protocol, to download or upload data and access other back-end services. Angular provides a client HTTP API for Angular applications, the `HttpClient` service class in `@angular/common/http`.

## Prerequisites

Before working with the `HttpClientModule`, you should have a basic understanding of the following:

*   TypeScript programming
*   Usage of the HTTP protocol
*   Angular application-design fundamentals, as described in [Angular Concepts](guide/architecture)
*   Observable techniques and operators.
    See the [Observables](guide/observables) guide.

## HTTP client service features

The HTTP client service offers the following major features.

*   The ability to request data from a server
*   Streamlined error handling
*   Testing-requests features
*   Request and response

## What's next

* Setup for server communication
